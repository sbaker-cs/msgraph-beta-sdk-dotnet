# Devolutions Fork – Microsoft Graph Beta SDK for .NET

This repository contains a customized and reduced-size build of the
*Microsoft Graph Beta SDK for .NET*.

## Origin

This fork is based on the original project published by Microsoft:
https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-beta-sdk-dotnet

## Purpose

The goal of this fork is to create a smaller, optimized DLL for use within
Devolutions' products (e.g., Remote Desktop Manager), and to ensure that we
always build against a controlled and known version of the SDK.
